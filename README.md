#AIR POLLUTION IN INDIA ANALYSIS

**ABSTRACT**
Air pollution has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental and public health concerns of the 21st century. This study focuses on analyzing air pollution data across multiple urban centers, assessing pollutant concentrations, air quality index (AQI) variations, and temporal trends. Using datasets that include key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO), we delve into how pollution levels fluctuate over time, across seasons, and between weekdays and weekends. By examining historical data, we provide insights into the worst and least affected cities, helping to identify the top five most polluted and least polluted locations during specified periods. Additionally, our analysis explores factors contributing to high pollution days and provides a breakdown of long-term patterns in air quality across different regions. By calculating metrics like the mean, median, and standard deviation of pollution levels, we identify unusual spikes, or outliers, that may suggest industrial incidents, weather-related impacts, or other pollution sources. We use visualization techniques, such as line charts, heatmaps, and stacked area charts, to illustrate cumulative pollutant levels over time and to track changes in AQI year- over-year in various cities. This analysis aims to support policymakers, urban planners, and environmental agencies by offering data-driven insights into pollution trends, helping to prioritize interventions, formulate regulatory policies, and promote sustainable practices. Our findings underscore the need for stricter air quality management in heavily impacted areas, while also celebrating improvements in regions where pollution control measures have been effective. The study serves as a resource for understanding air pollution dynamics and fostering strategies to mitigate its adverse effects on public health and the environment.


**DATASET**
The data for this analysis has been gathered from a variety of reputable sources, including governmental environmental monitoring agencies, satellite observations, and publicly available air quality datasets. It includes measurements of key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, NO, NH3 and CO) across different cities, recorded over several years, with daily updates to capture real-time variations in air quality. Each record includes information on pollutant concentration levels, air quality index (AQI), date and time of measurement, geographical location, and weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, metadata on seasonal and weekly trends is integrated to allow for a comprehensive understanding of pollution dynamics.
